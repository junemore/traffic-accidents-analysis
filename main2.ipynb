    "\n",
    "Fatal accidents take away more than 30,000 lives every year in the U.S. (NHTSA), and traffic safety have been concern of many people for years not only beacuase people want to reduce deaths from traffic accidents, but also reduce accident severity. One way to accomplish reducing fatality from traffice accident is to identify the most probable factors that affect accident severity.<br/>\n",
    "In our final project, we want to identify the most probable factors that affect fatal accidents and accident severity through performing logistic regression, analyzing, and discussing how the important factors obtained from logistic regression affect fatal accidents. Specifically, we will explore how human error, enviorment, and use of alcohol contribute to fatal accidents.\n",

    "The data we used to perform logistic regression are all crashes happened in Allegheny County from 2004 to 2016. The file recorded whether the crashes are fatal or non-fatal. Because of this binary nature of the dependent variable, a logistic regression approach was found suitable.<br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of using logistic regression to do analysis is the same as using other model-building technique in statistics: to find the best fit and the most parsimonious one. The difference between logistic and linear regression is the response variable of logistic regression is binary. Once this difference is accounted for, the methods employed in an analysis using logistic regression follow the same general principle in linear regression analysis: \n",

    "$$E( y | X )=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where y is response variable, in this case, fatal and non-fatal accidents, and X are marix of features, and $\\beta$ are parameter. <br/>\n",
    "The specific form of logistic regression is: $$\\pi(X)=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1X}} {1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1X}} $$\n",
    "where $\\pi(X)$ is $y$, the probability of being fatal accident. \n",
    "We used $\\pi(X)$ as an classfier to classify whether a accident fatal accident or non-fatal accidents in notebook1, altough this classification method is sample and have a lot of draw back, it have 90% accuary, which indicates that the feature we selected in the logistic regression is helpful in identify and predict traffic safety.\n",

We can see from the fatal accident v.s. location graph, east coast had more fatal accidents than west coast and the central of U.S, and that being said, the higher poplulation density there was, the more fatal accidents tend to happened. And also we have another interesting observation, the distribition of fatal accidents on the map looks very simmilar to the picture below, the U.S. highway map. We can indentify  major highways in the U.S. in the the fatal accident v.s. location graph as they were highlighted in the graph.

A heavy snow squall, dense fog, or blinding rain can reduce visibility from good to just a few feet in front of you in a matter of seconds.Most of all Snow day usually indicates the worst of driving condition: limited visibility, snow blindness and the lost of traction.\n",

    "As mention before, road danger is a man-made crisis, with human error accounting for over 90 percent of accidents (Smith). More than 90 percent of road accidents are caused by human error. To understand what kind of human behaviors make driving less safe, we studied how speeding and drinking affects traffic safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speeding endangers everyone on the road; About 18% of fatal accidents involve speeding or speeding-related agressive driving behavior. We all know the frustrations of modern life and juggling a busy schedule, but speeding not only affects people's own safety, but it also endangers everyone else on the road. Sometime, even when you’re driving the speed limit but too fast for road conditions, for example, during bad weather, or when a road is under repair, it will still endangers your life becuase when you are driving fast, there is less time for you to react when you are in danger. Speed limits are designed to protect everyone on the road, so it is important for people to obey the law. \n",
    "![](fig/percentage_of_speeding.png)![](fig/speeding_age_density.png)\n",
    "Not only did we studied the percentage of fatal accidents which involved speeding, but we also studied which group of people are most likely to speed. We found that within all the people who had engaged in speeding-related activities, men are more likely to speed compared the same-age female before 65 years old; after 65 years old, women are more likely to speed than same-age man. And also, no matter man or women, there is a downward trend in the probability of speeding as age increases. The older and more experience people are, the more they understand the danger of speeding, the less likely will they drive over speed limit. However, Young people who imposive and less experienced, are much more likey to engage in speeding, sepically for young people who are in their 20s. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also looked in to alcohol violation in fatal accidents. While use of alcohol and the risks posed by alcohol for drivers have been well known for many decades, and many effort have been put in educating the public and making policy to prevent people from drunk driving, alcohol involvement is still one of the major factor which causes fatal accidents. Again, we found that in both nondrinking fatal accidents and drinking fatal accidents, young people who in their 20s are the most likely to involve in fatal accidents. \n",
    "However, it is obvious that age group in nondrinking fatal accidents are more spread out, and the proportion of young people involve in drinking fatal accidents is significantly larger than other age group. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that young people who in their 20s are the most likely to involve in both non drinking fatal accidents and drinking fatal accidents. The common explanation for this relationship is the inexperience and risk-taking of youthful drivers and the deterioration of driving skills.\n",
    "In 2015, there are 110,434,119 licensed male drivers and 107,649,686 licensed female drivers in the U.S. In other words, male and female take about 50% of driver population. However, in alcohol-involved fatal accidents, 71.2% of drinking drivers are male, and only 28.8% of drinking drivers are female. These statistic show that male are much more likely to involve in alcohol-related fatal accidents.\n",
    "![](fig/fatality_vs_age.png)![](fig/gender_vs_fatal_accidents.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring drunk drive and speeding, we wondered if there are any relationship between them, so we groupped drivers who drive after drinking and drivers who did not drink, and calculated the average speed of each group. Surprisingly, we find that drinking drivers have median speed of 65, and the median speed of non-drinking drivers is 45, which is much lower than drinking drivers. However, there is no big different on speeding between male and female, in both drinking and nondrinking case. \n",
    "In order to know whether drinking encourages speeding or not, we performed **two-sample-z-test** .\n",
    "We denoted nondrinking group group1, and drinking group2. We made the null hypothesis as there is no difference between the drinking group and the non drinking group, i.e :\n",

The test staitstic we got is greater than 1.96, which indicates that there are enough evidence to sugguest that the drinking group and non drinking group are statistically significantly different.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Our fatal accident analysis identifies key features and elements which have significant influence on fatal accidents. Even though we used simple logistic regression, which is not the best model and has a lot of drawbacks, it helped us found factors that are influential to traffice safety. <br/>\n",
    "In our analysis, we found that, the higher population density it is, the more likely to have fatal accidents. And on average, young people who are in their 20s are more likely to involve in drunk drive and speeding, espically for male drivers. Moreover, speeding and drunk drive not only cause a significant share of totoal fatal accidents and increase the possibility of death, but also drunk drive is dangerous becuase it promotes speeding behavior which further enhance the chance of involving in fatal accidents.<br/>\n",
